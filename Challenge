I challenge you to make a python text based calculator in under 5 mins but with a twist. You have to make the text a different colour whether it's a 
multiplication, division, subtraction or addition equasion. If you wish to takeon the coloured text challenge your time limit is 10 or 15 minutes depending 
on how confident you feel. Have fun coding!
